## Visit the site at https://udhayashan1.github.io/forex-ml-exploration/#/

A step-by-step machine learning exploration of foreign exchange (forex) pairs.

## **ðŸš€ Overview**  
This project explores different machine learning approaches for forex price prediction, uncovering key insights and common pitfalls along the way. 

## **1. Introduction**
âœ… **The Misleading Accuracy of Regression Models**  
- Why naive regression models fail in forex prediction  
- How models can produce **"good-looking" but useless predictions**  
- The issue of **predicting past prices instead of future trends**

âœ… **The Case for Classification**  
- Why classification is a better target than regression for our models
- Predicting price direction (up/down) is more actionable than predicting exact values.

## 2. **Naive Models**
âœ… **Introduction to Logistic Regression**
- How logistic regression is used for forex prediction
- The sigmoid function and its role in probability-based predictions
- Decision boundary and how it determines buy/sell signals
- Play Around with Logistic Regression with built-in logistic calculator! It is kind of fun

## ðŸ”œ Logistic Regression Code and Results

Stay tuned as we refine our approach and explore **more effective trading strategies with ML**! ðŸš€ðŸ“Š
