# **ðŸ“Œ Moving from Regression to Classification in Forex Prediction**

After exploring regression-based price prediction, we found that **naive models tend to simply replicate past prices** rather than truly forecasting future movements. While this results in **low Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, it provides **little practical value for trading**.  

To build a **more actionable model**, we shift our focus from predicting exact price values to **predicting the direction of price movement**â€”a **classification task**. This turns 
out to be a much harder task.

## **Why is Classification More Useful?**  

### _Direction Matters More Than Exact Price_

In trading, knowing whether the price will rise or fall is often more valuable than knowing the exact future price.

A small price difference can still be profitable if the direction is correctly predicted.

### _Avoiding the Pitfall of Overfitting to Past Prices_

In regression, the model minimizes MSE by staying close to past values, leading to predictions that mimic a moving average.

With classification, the model is forced to differentiate between rising and falling markets, leading to a more meaningful prediction.

## **ðŸ“Œ How Do We Define the Classification Task?**  

Recall for our regression task, we set target as the literal price of \`lookahead\` days

\`\`\`python
#Predict next days closing price
lookahead = 1
df['Target'] = df['Close'].shift(-lookahead)
df.dropna(inplace=True)
\`\`\`

Instead, we set it to a binary target of whether closing price of \`lookahead\` days ahead is higher or lower than current.

\`\`\`python
#Predict next days closing price
lookahead = 1
df['Target'] = np.where(df['Close'].shift(-lookahead) > df['Close'], 1, 0)
df.dropna(inplace=True)
\`\`\`
